# Email Templates for AI Restaurant Manager Kit

## Template 1: Pain + Proof (Warm Outreach)

**Use when:** You have an existing relationship with the restaurant owner

**Subject Line:** Quick question about [Restaurant Name]'s staffing situation

---

**Email Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I've been following [Restaurant Name] for a while now – [compliment about their food/social media/reputation, e.g., "your new spring menu looks amazing"].

I know staffing in restaurants has been brutal lately. Between finding reliable servers, managing shifts, and keeping labor costs under control, it's a constant headache.

I wanted to share something that might help: I built an AI Restaurant Manager Kit that's designed specifically for places like yours. It handles scheduling, automates inventory ordering, and even helps with front-of-house operations.

A restaurant in [nearby city/area] – [Reference Restaurant] – cut their scheduling time by 75% and reduced no-shows by 60% in just 2 months. Here's what the owner said: *"I save 15+ hours a week on admin work. My staff loves the shift scheduling – no more confusion about who works when."*

Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week to see if it could work for [Restaurant Name]?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template 2: Cold Outreach

**Use when:** Reaching out to restaurant owners you haven't met

**Subject Line:** [Restaurant Name] + AI Restaurant Manager – 15 hrs/week saved?

---

**Email Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because I think [Restaurant Name] could benefit from something we've built for restaurants in the Boston/Cape Cod area.

Running a restaurant means wearing a million hats – and admin work piles up fast. The AI Restaurant Manager Kit helps with:

- **Smart scheduling** – Auto-generate shifts based on demand forecasts
- **Inventory management** – Automated ordering before you run low
- **Staff communication** – Automated shift reminders and shift swaps
- **Labor cost tracking** – Real-time visibility into overtime and costs

We're currently working with [X] restaurants in the area, including [Reference Restaurant Name] who said: *"I was skeptical at first, but now I can't imagine running without it. It's like having a virtual assistant who never sleeps."*

No pressure – happy to share more info or answer any questions. Would a quick 10-minute call work for you?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

## Best Practices for Email Outreach

1. **Personalize every message** – Mention something specific about their restaurant
2. **Keep it short** – Restaurant owners are busy; aim for 150-200 words
3. **Lead with value** – What's in it for them, not features
4. **Include social proof** – Local references work best
5. **Make next steps easy** – Always include a clear, simple call-to-action
6. **Follow up consistently** – 80% of sales happen after the 5th follow-up
