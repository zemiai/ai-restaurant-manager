Hey [First Name]! 👋

Love what you're doing at [Restaurant Name] – [specific compliment about their content, e.g., "that brunch spread looks incredible"].

I run a small tech company building tools for restaurants, and I built the AI Restaurant Manager Kit specifically for places like yours. It handles scheduling, inventory, and staff communication – stuff that eats up hours every week.

I saw you're pretty active on IG, so I wanted to connect. Would you be open to a quick chat about how it works? No pressure at all!

Thanks,
[Your Name]

Hey [First Name]! Just following up on my DM – I know Instagram gets busy.

No worries either way – love what you're doing! 🙌

In the meantime, keep killing it with the [compliment about their content]! 👨‍🍳

## DM Best Practices

### General Tips

1. **Be conversational** – DMs should feel like organic messages, not sales scripts
2. **Avoid links in first message** – They often get flagged as spam
3. **Reference their content** – Shows you've done your homework
4. **Keep it under 300 characters** – Shorter messages get higher response rates
5. **End with a question** – Opens the door for conversation
6. **Use their name** – Personalization increases engagement

### Platform-Specific Notes

**Instagram:**
- Emojis help (but don't overdo it)
- Engage with their posts before DMing
- Stories and Reels get more attention than feed posts

**LinkedIn:**
- More formal tone is appropriate
- Mention professional achievements
- Connect on shared industry experience

### Response Scripts

**If they say "Not interested":**
"Thanks for being upfront! If your needs change or you want to hear from other restaurant owners using it, I'm here. Best of luck with everything at [Restaurant Name]!"

**If they say "Tell me more":**
"Awesome! The AI Restaurant Manager Kit handles scheduling, inventory, and staff communication. Here's what a local restaurant said: [quote]. Want me to send a quick overview, or would you prefer a 10-minute call?"

**If they don't respond:**
Move to the follow-up sequence above. If no response after Day 7, mark as "cold" and move on.
