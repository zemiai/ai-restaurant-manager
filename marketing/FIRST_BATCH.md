## Personalized Template Versions

### Restaurant 1: The Lobster Trap (Wellfleet)

**Context:** Seasonal seafood restaurant, popular with tourists and locals, busy summer season

**Email Subject:** Quick question about The Lobster Trap's staffing this summer

**Personalized Email:**

Hi John,

I've been going to The Lobster Trap for years – your lobster rolls are the best on the Cape!

I know summer staffing is always a challenge on the Outer Cape. Between seasonal workers and busy rushes, managing schedules must be chaos.

I built an AI Restaurant Manager Kit that handles scheduling, inventory, and staff communication. A seafood restaurant in Chatham cut their scheduling time by 80% and reduced no-shows after using it.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to see if it could help The Lobster Trap this season?

Best,

### Restaurant 2: Bluewater Grille (Chatham)

**Context:** Upscale dining, likely has a more professional owner/manager, mid-price point

**LinkedIn Subject:** Bluewater Grille + AI Restaurant Manager

**Personalized LinkedIn:**

Hi Sarah,

Impressive work growing Bluewater Grille into a destination restaurant. Your wine program and seasonal menus show real attention to detail.

I develop AI tools for restaurants, and the AI Restaurant Manager Kit might help with your back-of-house operations. It handles:

- Smart scheduling based on reservations and seasonality
- Automated inventory ordering (helpful for fresh seafood)
- Staff communication for shift coordination

I'd love to share how other upscale Cape Cod restaurants are using it. Would a 10-minute call work for you?

**Personalized Email:**

Hi Mike,

Love what you're doing at Cape Cod Kitchen – my family ate there last month, great experience!

Running a family restaurant with that volume means you're probably spending way too much time on scheduling and ordering. I built an AI Restaurant Manager Kit for places like yours.

Another Hyannis restaurant saved 15+ hours a week on admin work and cut their inventory costs by 12%. Happy to share more info or connect you with them.

Love Beacon Hill Bistro's vibe – that interior design update looks incredible!

Other Boston restaurants are saving 10+ hours a week on admin. Would you be open to a quick chat? No pressure!

Harborview has the best views in Gloucester – last dinner there was amazing.

Operating a waterfront restaurant with seasonal fluctuations must keep you busy. I built an AI Restaurant Manager Kit that handles the operational complexity.

**Context:** Italian cuisine, likely family recipes, traditional operations

**Email Subject:** Tony's Italian Kitchen + restaurant tech?

**Personalized Email:**

Hi James,

Tony's Italian Kitchen has such a great reputation – your grandmother's recipes clearly work!

I know traditional Italian places sometimes hesitate about new tech, but the AI Restaurant Manager is designed to be simple. It handles the scheduling and inventory so you can focus on the food.

A North End restaurant owner told me: *"It saves me time without changing how I run my kitchen."*

Happy to share more info or put you in touch. Would that be helpful?
