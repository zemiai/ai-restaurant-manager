[00:00 - 00:30] INTRO
---------------------
SCREEN: Title card "Troubleshooting Common Issues"
TTS: "Having trouble? Don't worry. This video covers the most common
issues and how to fix them quickly. Let's get you back up and running."




[00:30 - 01:30] COMMON ISSUES - TOAST
-------------------------------------
SCREEN: Show error messages list
SCREEN: "API connection failed" screen
SCREEN: "Invalid credentials" screen
TTS: "First, Toast connection problems. If you see 'API connection failed',
check your internet connection and make sure your API credentials are
correct in config.yaml. Remember, Toast API keys are case-sensitive.
Also, ensure your Toast account has API access enabled."




[01:30 - 02:30] COMMON ISSUES - GMAIL
-------------------------------------
SCREEN: Show OAuth error
SCREEN: Show "permission denied" screen
TTS: "For Gmail issues, if OAuth fails, delete the token.json file in
the project folder and run setup-gmail-auth again. If you see permission
denied, make sure you're using a Google Workspace account, not a personal
Gmail. Business accounts work best with OAuth."




[02:30 - 03:30] COMMON ISSUES - TELEGRAM
-----------------------------------------
SCREEN: Show "bot not in group" error
SCREEN: Show "unknown chat" error
TTS: "Telegram problems? Make sure your bot is actually in the Telegram
group and has permission to send messages. If you get 'unknown chat',
run get-chat-id again after sending a fresh message in the group.
Sometimes the chat ID changes if the bot was re-added."




[03:30 - 04:30] HOW TO DEBUG
-----------------------------
SCREEN: Terminal showing log files
SCREEN: Run debug command
SCREEN: Show error logs
TTS: "When something breaks, check the logs. Run debug-mode from the
terminal to see detailed error messages. Logs are saved in the logs
folder with timestamps. Most errors will tell you exactly what's wrong.
Common culprits: wrong file paths, missing credentials, expired tokens."




[04:30 - 05:00] WHERE TO GET HELP
----------------------------------
SCREEN: Show documentation website
SCREEN: Show community forum
SCREEN: Show support email
TTS: "Need more help? First, check the documentation at our website -
it's searchable and covers everything in depth. Join our community
forum to ask questions and see solutions from other users. For urgent
issues, email support with your error logs attached. We're here to help!"
