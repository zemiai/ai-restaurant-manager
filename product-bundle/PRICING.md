# Pricing — The AI Restaurant Manager Kit

## Pricing Philosophy

We believe restaurant owners should own their tools, not rent them forever. That's why The AI Restaurant Manager Kit is a **one-time purchase** with no monthly fees for the software itself.

You only pay for:
- The software (one-time)
- Your Toast POS subscription (direct to Toast)
- MiniMax API usage (direct to MiniMax, ~$5-10/month)
- Hardware (one-time)

This means you **save $1,200-$6,000+ per year** compared to traditional SaaS alternatives.
