# Sales Page — The AI Restaurant Manager Kit

---

## The Headline

# Turn Your Raspberry Pi Into A 24/7 Restaurant Manager

**Automate POS, invoices, voice announcements, daily briefings, and more—without monthly SaaS fees.**

---

## The Hook

### Stop Paying $150+/Month For Tools That Should Cost $0

Imagine walking into your restaurant every morning and having everything ready for you:

☕ Your sales numbers from yesterday, summarized
📧 Vendor bills already categorized and filed
📋 Today's opening checklist, personalized for your team
🔊 Daily specials announced automatically to staff
💰 Upsell opportunities identified and ready to deploy

**That's not a dream. That's what The AI Restaurant Manager Kit does—on a $80 computer that never sleeps, never demands a raise, and never locks you into a contract.**

---

## The Problem

### Restaurant Owners Are Getting Ripped Off By SaaS

Every month, you're forking over $150, $300, even $500 to software companies for tools that:

- **Lock you in** — Try leaving, and good luck extracting your data
- **Own your data** — Your sales records, your customer info, your recipes—their database
- **Charge forever** — Stop using the tool? You get nothing, and you start over
- **Nickel-and-dime** — "Oh, you want reports? That's +$50/month. API access? +$100/month."
- **Change the rules** — Features you rely on disappear with a week's notice

**Meanwhile, you're running on 5% profit margins.**

---

## The Solution

### Own Your Tools. Own Your Data. Own Your Future.

The AI Restaurant Manager Kit is different:

✅ **One-time purchase** — Pay once, own forever
✅ **Your data stays yours** — All local, all encrypted, all yours
✅ **No lock-in** — Export everything, anytime, no questions
✅ **No monthly fees** — Your Toast subscription + ~$5-10/month for TTS API = that's it
✅ **Runs on $80 hardware** — Raspberry Pi 5 does the work
✅ **Complete control** — Modify, extend, break, fix—it's your system

**You're not renting software. You're building infrastructure.**
